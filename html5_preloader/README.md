# HTML5 Preloader - Will preload assets into a page similar to Flash

by [Joseph](http://jbkflex.wordpress.com).


###Work in progress for a modular based HTML5 Preloader 
that will preload assets into a HTML5 page before tha pplication runs. 
This will give a similar experience like Flash preloaders. 
The main idea is to create dynamic elements in java script and then load the assets into the page behind the scenes. A counter
keeps track of the number of assets loaded and based on that, the preloader progress is determined.
